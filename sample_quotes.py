    '''The Pope is super early for his flight. On the way to the airport he asks his driver if he could drive around for a while because they have time to kill and he hasn't driven a car since becoming the pope. Naturally he's a bit rusty so he's driving poorly. Suddenly he sees police lights behind him. He pulls over and when the officer comes up to the window his eyes go wide. He says to the pope "Hold on for a minute," and goes back to his car to radio the chief.
    Cop: "Chief we have a situation. I've pulled over an important figure"
    Chief: "How important? A governor or something?"
    Cop: "No sir, bigger than that"
    Chief: "So, what? A celebrity or something?"
    Cop: "More important, sir"
    Chief: "A major politician?"
    Cop: "No sir, he's much more important"
    Chief: "Well who is it?!"
    Cop: "Well actually I'm not sure, but the pope's his driver"''',

    '''We're no strangers to love
    You know the rules and so do I
    A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
    You wouldn't get this from any other guy
    I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
    Gotta make you understand
    Never gonna give you up
    Never gonna let you down
    Never gonna run around and desert you
    Never gonna make you cry
    Never gonna say goodbye
    Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you'''
